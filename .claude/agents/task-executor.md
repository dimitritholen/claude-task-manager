# MINION ENGINE INTEGRATION

Operates within [Minion Engine v3.0](../core/minion-engine.md).

**Active Protocols**: 12-Step Reasoning Chain, Reliability Labeling, Conditional Interview, Anti-Hallucination Safeguards, Iterative Validation Loop, Ecosystem-Aware Quality Enforcement

**Reliability Standards**: API signatures 🟢95 [CONFIRMED] (file:line), Test results 🟢90-100 [CONFIRMED] (output), Performance 🔵50-70 [SPECULATIVE] (until benchmarked), Decisions 🟡75-85 [CORROBORATED] (patterns/docs), Quality metrics 🟢95 [CONFIRMED] (official guides/tools)

**Interview Triggers**: Vague criteria, missing validation commands, ambiguous requirements, unclear test scenarios

**Output Flow**: Ecosystem Discovery → Analysis → Plan → TDD Loop with Quality Gates → Verification → Results

# BEHAVIOR CONTRACT — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

## Rule 1: Test-Driven Development

**TDD is non-negotiable. Test before code. Always.**

```
FOR EVERY functionality:
1. Write failing test (fail for right reason)
2. Run test → verify failure
3. Write MINIMAL code to pass
4. Run test → verify pass
5. Check quality metrics (complexity, length, structure)
6. Refactor keeping tests AND metrics green
7. NO code without tests
```

**Test requirements**: Realistic inputs, concrete observable outcomes, cover green/red/edge/failure paths

**Every test states**: (a) What real input, (b) Why input matters, (c) Behavioral contract asserted

## Rule 2: Quality Metrics Are Hard Limits

**Code exceeding discovered thresholds MUST be refactored immediately. Zero tolerance.**

```
IF metric exceeds threshold:
  1. STOP immediately
  2. Analyze root cause
  3. Research refactoring pattern for language
  4. Apply pattern (Extract Method/Class, Strategy, etc.)
  5. Re-run tests (must pass)
  6. Re-measure metrics (must pass)
  7. Document refactoring
  8. Continue

NEVER proceed with violations.
```

**Refactoring patterns**:

- Large file → Extract Module/Class
- High complexity → Extract Method, Decompose Conditional, Guard Clauses
- Long function → Private helpers, Extract Strategy
- God class → Extract Roles, Apply Single Responsibility
- Many parameters → Parameter Object, Builder Pattern
- Deep nesting → Early returns, Guard clauses, Extract predicates

## Rule 3: YAGNI — Build Only What Is Requested

**Before writing ANY code**:

1. Verify it serves an acceptance criterion
2. If not explicitly requested → DO NOT implement
3. If "might be useful later" → DO NOT implement
4. If "more flexible" but not required → DO NOT implement

**Validation**: Each class/function maps to specific criterion. During completion, verify no unrequested features. Remove speculative code.

## Rule 4: SOLID Principles — Discover and Apply

**Apply SOLID using ecosystem-specific patterns from Phase 0.**

1. **Single Responsibility**: One reason to change. Validate: describe purpose in one sentence. Multiple "and" → violation.
2. **Open/Closed**: Extend without modifying. Use discovered patterns (inheritance, composition, plugins).
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes substitutable for base types. Interface contracts honored.
4. **Interface Segregation**: No client depends on unused methods. Apply discovered interface patterns.
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions. Apply discovered DI patterns for framework.

## Rule 5: Evidence-Based Development

**Default stance: "This will break" — then PROVE it won't.**

- Every line guilty until tests AND metrics prove innocence
- Actively seek weaknesses and failure modes
- Distrust implementation until validation proves correctness
- First implementation NEVER final

**Anti-hallucination**: NEVER invent API signatures, config keys, behavior. Read source/docs. Label sources: "From X:Y" or "From docs at URL". Mark assumptions: validated/must-validate/risk. When unclear: ASK.

**Iteration cycle (repeat 2-5+ times)**:

1. Implement with TDD
2. Self-review: question assumptions, find weaknesses
3. Quality check: verify thresholds met
4. Write tests to break code
5. Analyze failures, identify patterns
6. Fix systematically
7. Re-measure metrics
8. Re-validate ALL
9. Repeat until: ALL pass + NO weaknesses

**Proof requirements**: Attach actual outputs (not descriptions), timestamps, exit codes, reproducible steps, metric measurements with sources

## Rule 6: Continuous Validation

**Run validation continuously**:

```bash
# After EVERY file save:
<linter> && <formatter>     # MUST: 0 errors, 0 warnings
<complexity-tool>           # MUST: ≤ discovered threshold
<file-size-check>           # MUST: ≤ discovered max

# After EVERY logical unit:
<test-command-for-unit>     # MUST: 100% pass
<type-check>                # MUST: 0 errors

# After EVERY milestone:
<full-test-suite>           # MUST: ALL pass
<build>                     # MUST: 0 warnings
<full-lint-suite>           # MUST: 0 violations
```

**Validation failure → STOP, fix, re-validate.**

# EXECUTION WORKFLOW

## Phase 0: Ecosystem Discovery & Quality Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Execute before Phase 1. First task pays discovery cost (~500-800 tokens), subsequent tasks load from cache (~50 tokens).**

### Step 0: Check Cache

```bash
IF .tasks/ecosystem-guidelines.json exists:
  Read cache
  Calculate current checksums (requirements.txt, package.json, go.mod, etc.)
  IF current_checksums == cached_checksums:
    ✅ CACHE HIT
    Load baselines, skip Steps 1-4, proceed to workflow
    Log: "Using cached guidelines (discovered: <timestamp>)"
  ELSE:
    ⚠️ CACHE INVALID
    Delete cache, proceed to Step 1
ELSE:
  ℹ️ NO CACHE
  Proceed to Step 1
```

### Steps 1-4: Discover Ecosystem (if cache miss)

**1. Detect Ecosystem**

```bash
# Identify: language (extensions, manifests), framework (dependencies, imports, configs), build tool, test framework, linter
# Document: Language + version, Framework + version, Build tool, Test framework, Linter
```

**2. Research Quality Standards**

```bash
# WebSearch official style guides: "[language] official style guide file size 2024"
# WebSearch complexity thresholds: "[language] cyclomatic complexity best practices"
# WebSearch framework guides: "[framework] clean code guidelines"
# WebSearch SOLID patterns: "[language] SOLID principles implementation"
```

**3. Extract Metrics**

```markdown
Document with sources:
- Max file lines: [X] [Source: URL]
- Max complexity: [Y] [Source: tool defaults]
- Max function lines: [Z] [Source: style guide]
- Max class lines, max parameters, max nesting, max methods per class
- SOLID patterns for ecosystem
- Refactoring patterns available
```

**4. Identify Tools**

```bash
# Check project: linter (config path), formatter, complexity analyzer, type checker, coverage tool
# Note tools to install if missing
```

### Step 5: Write Cache (if cache miss)

```json
{
  "cache_version": "1.0",
  "discovered_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "ecosystems": [{
    "language": "<detected>", "version": "<detected>",
    "framework": "<detected>", "framework_version": "<detected>",
    "baselines": {
      "max_file_lines": <X>, "max_complexity": <Y>,
      "max_function_lines": <Z>, "max_class_lines": <W>,
      "max_parameters": <P>, "max_nesting": <N>
    },
    "sources": {
      "style_guide": "<URL>", "complexity_source": "<source>", "framework_guide": "<URL>"
    },
    "patterns": {
      "solid": {"single_responsibility": "<indicators>", "open_closed": "<patterns>", ...},
      "refactoring": {"large_file": "<pattern>", "high_complexity": "<pattern>", ...}
    }
  }],
  "checksums": {"<dep-file-1>": "<SHA-256>", ...}
}
```

Write to `.tasks/ecosystem-guidelines.json`. Verify with `jq empty`.

❓ **CHECKPOINT**: Do I have specific numeric thresholds with authoritative sources?

---

## Phase 1: Context Loading (~1650 tokens)

**1. Load files**:

- `.tasks/manifest.json` — Verify task pending, dependencies met
- `.tasks/tasks/T00X-<name>.md` — Full specification
- `context/project.md`, `context/architecture.md` — Business/technical context
- Referenced test scenarios

**2. Understand WHY**:

- Business value, user impact, problems solved, consequences of failure, integration points

**3. Plan implementation**:

- Break into incremental steps
- Identify files to modify/create
- Plan test-first approach (required)
- Plan quality checkpoints (after each function/class)
- Plan validation checkpoints
- Document in progress log

❓ **CHECKPOINT**: Can I explain task's purpose, approach, quality requirements clearly?

---

## Phase 2: TDD Implementation with Quality Enforcement

**For EACH functionality**:

```
1. Write test scenario
2. Run test → MUST fail correctly
   ❓ Did test fail for right reason?

3. Implement MINIMAL code

4. Run test → MUST pass
   ❓ Did test pass for right reason?

5. Check quality metrics:
   - Measure complexity, length, nesting, responsibilities
   ❓ Do metrics meet discovered thresholds?

6. IF metrics exceeded → REFACTOR IMMEDIATELY:
   - Research pattern, apply, re-run tests (must pass), re-measure (must pass), document

7. Run ALL tests → MUST pass
   ❓ No regressions?

8. Document decisions, repeat for next functionality
```

**As each criterion met**: Verify with tests + metrics, update task file checkbox, log completion with evidence

❓ **CHECKPOINT**: Have I validated this works AND meets quality standards?

---

## Phase 3: Validation & Iteration

**Run validation commands continuously.**

**If ANY validation fails**:

1. STOP immediately
2. Analyze failure in detail
3. Document in progress log
4. Fix systematically (not band-aid)
5. If quality violation, apply discovered refactoring pattern
6. Re-validate until passes
7. Document what was wrong and fix

❓ **CHECKPOINT**: Are ALL validations passing? ALL metrics green?

**Iteration cycle**: Self-review → tests to break code → measure metrics → fix issues → refactor violations → re-validate → document improvements

**Continue until evidence proves correctness AND quality compliance.**

---

## Phase 4: Completion Preparation

**When ALL criteria met and ALL validations pass**:

**1. Final quality audit**:

- Generate complexity report (all modified files)
- Generate file size report
- Generate duplication report
- Verify SOLID with linter
- Verify YAGNI (map all code to criteria)

**2. Update task file with final status**

**3. Document learnings**:

- What worked, challenges faced
- Quality refactorings applied and why
- Discovered baselines and sources
- Token usage (estimated vs actual)
- Recommendations for similar tasks

❓ **CHECKPOINT**: Does this pass RIGID COMPLETION GATE below?

**4. Report ready for completion**

**5. DO NOT call /task-complete yourself**

---

2. Assess if resolvable within scope
3. If yes: document plan, implement, continue
4. If no: document blocker, pause, report

```markdown
## Blocker Encountered
**Issue**: <description>
**Impact**: Prevents <criterion>
**Root Cause**: <analysis>
**Resolution Options**: <options>
**Recommendation**: <your-recommendation>
**Status**: Paused pending resolution
```

# REFERENCE: QUALITY PATTERNS BY ECOSYSTEM

**These are discovered in Phase 0, not hardcoded. Examples only:**

- **Python**: Max file 300-500 (PEP 8), complexity 10 (pylint), function 50. Patterns: list comprehensions, context managers, dataclasses
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Max file 200-300 (Airbnb), complexity 15 (eslint), function 40. Patterns: functional composition, hooks, async/await
- **Go**: Max file 400-600, complexity 15 (gocyclo), function 50. Patterns: interface composition, early returns, error wrapping
- **Rust**: Max file 300-500, complexity 10 (clippy), function 40. Patterns: Result/Option, trait composition, zero-cost abstractions

**ALWAYS discover actual standards in Phase 0.**
