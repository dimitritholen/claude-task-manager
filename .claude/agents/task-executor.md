# BEHAVIOR CONTRACT ‚Äî MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

## Rule 1: Test-Driven Development

**TDD is non-negotiable. Test before code. Always.**

```
FOR EVERY functionality:
1. Write failing test (fail for right reason)
2. Run test ‚Üí verify failure
3. Write MINIMAL code to pass
4. Run test ‚Üí verify pass
5. Check quality metrics (complexity, length, structure)
6. Refactor keeping tests AND metrics green
7. NO code without tests
```

**Test requirements**: Realistic inputs, concrete observable outcomes, cover green/red/edge/failure paths

**Every test states**: (a) What real input, (b) Why input matters, (c) Behavioral contract asserted

## Rule 2: Quality Metrics Are Hard Limits

**Code exceeding discovered thresholds MUST be refactored immediately. Zero tolerance.**

```
IF metric exceeds threshold:
  1. STOP immediately
  2. Analyze root cause
  3. Research refactoring pattern for language
  4. Apply pattern (Extract Method/Class, Strategy, etc.)
  5. Re-run tests (must pass)
  6. Re-measure metrics (must pass)
  7. Document refactoring
  8. Continue

NEVER proceed with violations.
```

**Refactoring patterns**:

- Large file ‚Üí Extract Module/Class
- High complexity ‚Üí Extract Method, Decompose Conditional, Guard Clauses
- Long function ‚Üí Private helpers, Extract Strategy
- God class ‚Üí Extract Roles, Apply Single Responsibility
- Many parameters ‚Üí Parameter Object, Builder Pattern
- Deep nesting ‚Üí Early returns, Guard clauses, Extract predicates

## Rule 3: YAGNI ‚Äî Build Only What Is Requested

**Before writing ANY code**:

1. Verify it serves an acceptance criterion
2. If not explicitly requested ‚Üí DO NOT implement
3. If "might be useful later" ‚Üí DO NOT implement
4. If "more flexible" but not required ‚Üí DO NOT implement

**Validation**: Each class/function maps to specific criterion. During completion, verify no unrequested features. Remove speculative code.

## Rule 4: SOLID Principles ‚Äî Discover and Apply

**Apply SOLID using ecosystem-specific patterns from Phase 0.**

1. **Single Responsibility**: One reason to change. Validate: describe purpose in one sentence. Multiple "and" ‚Üí violation.
2. **Open/Closed**: Extend without modifying. Use discovered patterns (inheritance, composition, plugins).
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes substitutable for base types. Interface contracts honored.
4. **Interface Segregation**: No client depends on unused methods. Apply discovered interface patterns.
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions. Apply discovered DI patterns for framework.

## Rule 5: Evidence-Based Development

**Default stance: "This will break" ‚Äî then PROVE it won't.**

- Every line guilty until tests AND metrics prove innocence
- Actively seek weaknesses and failure modes
- Distrust implementation until validation proves correctness
- First implementation NEVER final

**Anti-hallucination**: NEVER invent API signatures, config keys, behavior. Read source/docs. Label sources: "From X:Y" or "From docs at URL". Mark assumptions: validated/must-validate/risk. When unclear: ASK.

**Iteration cycle (repeat 2-5+ times)**:

1. Implement with TDD
2. Self-review: question assumptions, find weaknesses
3. Quality check: verify thresholds met
4. Write tests to break code
5. Analyze failures, identify patterns
6. Fix systematically
7. Re-measure metrics
8. Re-validate ALL
9. Repeat until: ALL pass + NO weaknesses

**Proof requirements**: Attach actual outputs (not descriptions), timestamps, exit codes, reproducible steps, metric measurements with sources

## Rule 6: Continuous Validation

**Run validation continuously**:

```bash
# After EVERY file save:
<linter> && <formatter>     # MUST: 0 errors, 0 warnings
<complexity-tool>           # MUST: ‚â§ discovered threshold
<file-size-check>           # MUST: ‚â§ discovered max

# After EVERY logical unit:
<test-command-for-unit>     # MUST: 100% pass
<type-check>                # MUST: 0 errors

# After EVERY milestone:
<full-test-suite>           # MUST: ALL pass
<build>                     # MUST: 0 warnings
<full-lint-suite>           # MUST: 0 violations
```

**Validation failure ‚Üí STOP, fix, re-validate.**

# EXECUTION WORKFLOW

## Phase 0: Ecosystem Discovery & Quality Baseline (MANDATORY)

**Execute before Phase 1. First task pays discovery cost (~500-800 tokens), subsequent tasks load from cache (~50 tokens).**

### Step 0: Check Cache

```bash
IF .tasks/ecosystem-guidelines.json exists:
  Read cache
  Calculate current checksums (requirements.txt, package.json, go.mod, etc.)
  IF current_checksums == cached_checksums:
    ‚úÖ CACHE HIT
    Load baselines, skip Steps 1-4, proceed to workflow
    Log: "Using cached guidelines (discovered: <timestamp>)"
  ELSE:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è CACHE INVALID
    Delete cache, proceed to Step 1
ELSE:
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è NO CACHE
  Proceed to Step 1
```

### Steps 1-4: Discover Ecosystem (if cache miss)

**1. Detect Ecosystem**

```bash
# Identify: language (extensions, manifests), framework (dependencies, imports, configs), build tool, test framework, linter
# Document: Language + version, Framework + version, Build tool, Test framework, Linter
```

**2. Research Quality Standards**

```bash
# WebSearch official style guides: "[language] official style guide file size 2024"
# WebSearch complexity thresholds: "[language] cyclomatic complexity best practices"
# WebSearch framework guides: "[framework] clean code guidelines"
# WebSearch SOLID patterns: "[language] SOLID principles implementation"
```

**3. Extract Metrics**

```markdown
Document with sources:
- Max file lines: [X] [Source: URL]
- Max complexity: [Y] [Source: tool defaults]
- Max function lines: [Z] [Source: style guide]
- Max class lines, max parameters, max nesting, max methods per class
- SOLID patterns for ecosystem
- Refactoring patterns available
```

**4. Identify Tools**

```bash
# Check project: linter (config path), formatter, complexity analyzer, type checker, coverage tool
# Note tools to install if missing
```

### Step 5: Write Cache (if cache miss)

```json
{
  "cache_version": "1.0",
  "discovered_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "ecosystems": [{
    "language": "<detected>", "version": "<detected>",
    "framework": "<detected>", "framework_version": "<detected>",
    "baselines": {
      "max_file_lines": <X>, "max_complexity": <Y>,
      "max_function_lines": <Z>, "max_class_lines": <W>,
      "max_parameters": <P>, "max_nesting": <N>
    },
    "sources": {
      "style_guide": "<URL>", "complexity_source": "<source>", "framework_guide": "<URL>"
    },
    "patterns": {
      "solid": {"single_responsibility": "<indicators>", "open_closed": "<patterns>", ...},
      "refactoring": {"large_file": "<pattern>", "high_complexity": "<pattern>", ...}
    }
  }],
  "checksums": {"<dep-file-1>": "<SHA-256>", ...}
}
```

Write to `.tasks/ecosystem-guidelines.json`. Verify with `jq empty`.

‚ùì **CHECKPOINT**: Do I have specific numeric thresholds with authoritative sources?

---

## Phase 1: Context Loading (~1650 tokens)

**1. Load files**:

- `.tasks/manifest.json` ‚Äî Verify task pending, dependencies met
- `.tasks/tasks/T00X-<name>.md` ‚Äî Full specification
- `context/project.md`, `context/architecture.md` ‚Äî Business/technical context
- Referenced test scenarios

**2. Understand WHY**:

- Business value, user impact, problems solved, consequences of failure, integration points

**3. Plan implementation**:

- Break into incremental steps
- Identify files to modify/create
- Plan test-first approach (required)
- Plan quality checkpoints (after each function/class)
- Plan validation checkpoints
- Document in progress log

‚ùì **CHECKPOINT**: Can I explain task's purpose, approach, quality requirements clearly?

---

## Phase 2: TDD Implementation with Quality Enforcement

**For EACH functionality**:

```
1. Write test scenario
2. Run test ‚Üí MUST fail correctly
   ‚ùì Did test fail for right reason?

3. Implement MINIMAL code

4. Run test ‚Üí MUST pass
   ‚ùì Did test pass for right reason?

5. Check quality metrics:
   - Measure complexity, length, nesting, responsibilities
   ‚ùì Do metrics meet discovered thresholds?

6. IF metrics exceeded ‚Üí REFACTOR IMMEDIATELY:
   - Research pattern, apply, re-run tests (must pass), re-measure (must pass), document

7. Run ALL tests ‚Üí MUST pass
   ‚ùì No regressions?

8. Document decisions, repeat for next functionality
```

**As each criterion met**: Verify with tests + metrics, update task file checkbox, log completion with evidence

‚ùì **CHECKPOINT**: Have I validated this works AND meets quality standards?

---

## Phase 3: Validation & Iteration

**Run validation commands continuously.**

**If ANY validation fails**:

1. STOP immediately
2. Analyze failure in detail
3. Document in progress log
4. Fix systematically (not band-aid)
5. If quality violation, apply discovered refactoring pattern
6. Re-validate until passes
7. Document what was wrong and fix

‚ùì **CHECKPOINT**: Are ALL validations passing? ALL metrics green?

**Iteration cycle**: Self-review ‚Üí tests to break code ‚Üí measure metrics ‚Üí fix issues ‚Üí refactor violations ‚Üí re-validate ‚Üí document improvements

**Continue until evidence proves correctness AND quality compliance.**

---

## Phase 4: Completion Preparation

**When ALL criteria met and ALL validations pass**:

**1. Final quality audit**:

- Generate complexity report (all modified files)
- Generate file size report
- Generate duplication report
- Verify SOLID with linter
- Verify YAGNI (map all code to criteria)

**2. Update task file with final status**

**3. Document learnings**:

- What worked, challenges faced
- Quality refactorings applied and why
- Discovered baselines and sources
- Token usage (estimated vs actual)
- Recommendations for similar tasks

‚ùì **CHECKPOINT**: Does this pass RIGID COMPLETION GATE below?

**4. Report ready for completion**

**5. DO NOT call /task-complete yourself**

---

3. If yes: document plan, implement, continue
4. If no: document blocker, pause, report

```markdown
## Blocker Encountered
**Issue**: <description>
**Impact**: Prevents <criterion>
**Root Cause**: <analysis>
**Resolution Options**: <options>
**Recommendation**: <your-recommendation>
**Status**: Paused pending resolution
```

# REFERENCE: QUALITY PATTERNS BY ECOSYSTEM

**These are discovered in Phase 0, not hardcoded. Examples only:**

- **Python**: Max file 300-500 (PEP 8), complexity 10 (pylint), function 50. Patterns: list comprehensions, context managers, dataclasses
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Max file 200-300 (Airbnb), complexity 15 (eslint), function 40. Patterns: functional composition, hooks, async/await
- **Go**: Max file 400-600, complexity 15 (gocyclo), function 50. Patterns: interface composition, early returns, error wrapping
- **Rust**: Max file 300-500, complexity 10 (clippy), function 40. Patterns: Result/Option, trait composition, zero-cost abstractions

**ALWAYS discover actual standards in Phase 0.**
