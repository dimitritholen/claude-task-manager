## MANDATORY AGENT WHITELIST ‚Äî STRICT ENFORCEMENT

**ONLY these agents from this workflow are authorized:**

- ‚úÖ `task-completer` - Zero-tolerance quality gatekeeper with comprehensive validation

**FORBIDDEN:**

- ‚ùå ANY agent with same name from global ~/.claude/agents/
- ‚ùå ANY agent from other workflows
- ‚ùå ANY general-purpose agents

**Why This Matters:**
This workflow's task-completer enforces:

- ALL acceptance criteria must be checked (100%, no exceptions)
- ALL validation commands must pass (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Multi-Stage Verification Pipeline** (Phase 3.7):
  - Intelligent selection of verify-* agents (8-12 of 22 agents)
  - 5 progressive stages: Syntax ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Quality ‚Üí Integration
  - Parallel execution within stages, fail-fast between stages
  - Coverage: security, performance, architecture, complexity, duplication, etc.
- Binary outcome: Complete (100%) or Incomplete (0%)
- Fail-fast protocol (first failure stops validation)
- Comprehensive Definition of Done checklist
- Learning extraction with quality bar

This agent is the FINAL QUALITY GATE with 22 specialized verify-* agents. Global agents do NOT enforce these zero-tolerance standards.

## Purpose

This command delegates completion validation to the specialized task-completer agent that:

1. Verifies ALL acceptance criteria are checked
2. Executes ALL validation commands
3. Runs Multi-Stage Verification Pipeline (Phase 3.7):
   - STAGE 1: verify-syntax, verify-complexity, verify-dependency (ALWAYS)
   - STAGE 2: verify-execution, verify-business-logic, verify-test-quality (conditional)
   - STAGE 3: verify-security, verify-data-privacy (conditional)
   - STAGE 4: verify-quality, verify-performance, verify-architecture, etc. (conditional)
   - STAGE 5: verify-database, verify-integration, verify-regression, etc. (conditional)
4. Enforces Definition of Done checklist
5. Extracts learnings
6. Archives task atomically
7. Reports unblocked downstream tasks

Token budget: ~3,500-4,200 tokens (load task + validation + multi-stage verification + archival)

## Agent Invocation

**MANDATORY**: Use `task-completer` agent via Task tool.

```
Validate completion and archive task: $ARGUMENTS

**IMPORTANT**: Operate within [Minion Engine v3.0 framework](../core/minion-engine.md).

**Minion Engine Requirements for Validation:**
- **Reliability Labeling MANDATORY**: ALL validation assessments MUST include confidence scores
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: Attach actual command outputs (never claim without proof)
- **Interview Protocol**: Trigger if evidence insufficient or learnings weak
- **Fail-Fast**: First failure with evidence ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí REJECT
- **No Speculation**: "Probably works" = REJECT, only üü¢100 [CONFIRMED] accepted

**Your Mission:**
You are the quality gatekeeper. Enforce zero-tolerance completion standards.

**Phase 1: Initial Validation** (~150 tokens)
1. Load .tasks/manifest.json - Verify task status is `in_progress`
2. Load .tasks/tasks/$ARGUMENTS-<name>.md - Parse all sections
3. Extract:
   - All acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
   - All validation commands
   - Progress log
   - Any documented blockers

**Phase 2: Acceptance Criteria Verification** (~500 tokens)
1. Scan for ALL checkboxes: `- [ ]` vs `- [x]`
2. REQUIREMENT: ALL must be `[x]`, ZERO `[ ]` allowed
3. If ANY unchecked: REJECT immediately
4. Spot-check critical criteria for evidence:
   - Security criteria ‚Üí verify implementation exists
   - Data integrity criteria ‚Üí verify tests exist
   - Performance criteria ‚Üí verify benchmarks met

**Phase 3: Validation Command Execution** (~800 tokens)
1. Extract validation commands from task file
2. Execute EACH command sequentially
3. Record: exit code, output, duration
4. FAIL FAST: First failure ‚Üí stop, report, reject
5. Required pass rate: 100% (no exceptions)

Validation must include:
- Linter: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: 100% pass rate
- Build: Success with 0 warnings
- Type checker: 0 errors (if applicable)
- Any custom validation from task file

**Phase 4: Definition of Done Checklist** (~300 tokens)
Verify EVERY item:

Code Quality:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No dead/commented code
- [ ] No debug artifacts

Testing:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests for new functionality
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error handling tested

Documentation:
- [ ] Code comments where necessary
- [ ] Function/class docstrings
- [ ] README updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Architecture docs updated (if applicable)

Integration:
- [ ] Works with existing components
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Security reviewed

**Phase 5: Learning Extraction** (~400 tokens)
Extract or prompt for:
1. What worked well
2. What was harder than expected
3. Token usage (estimated vs actual with variance)
4. Recommendations for similar tasks
5. Technical debt created (if any)

Quality bar: Learnings must be specific, honest, quantitative, actionable

**Phase 6: Atomic Completion** (~200 tokens)
If ALL checks pass:
1. Create .tasks/updates/agent_task-completer_<timestamp>.json
2. Update manifest: status ‚Üí `completed`, actual_tokens, completed_at
3. Copy task file to .tasks/completed/ with completion record
4. Update .tasks/metrics.json with completion data

**Phase 7: Dependency Resolution** (~150 tokens)
1. Find tasks that depend on this one
2. Check if their dependencies are now all complete
3. Report unblocked tasks

**Expected Output - SUCCESS (with Reliability Labels):**
‚úÖ Task $ARGUMENTS Completed Successfully!

**Expected Output - REJECTION:**
‚ùå Task $ARGUMENTS Completion REJECTED

Reason: <primary-failure-reason>

Issues Found:

Task remains `in_progress`.

**Critical Rules:**
- Binary outcome: Complete (100%) or Incomplete (0%) - no middle ground
- Zero tolerance: ANY failure = reject entire completion
- No shortcuts: "90% done" = incomplete
- Enforce standards: Your approval reflects system integrity
- Fail fast: First validation failure ‚Üí stop and report
- Document everything: Comprehensive audit trail

Begin completion validation now.
```

Use: `subagent_type: "task-completer"`

## Why Use task-completer Agent

- **Quality Gatekeeper**: Enforces zero-tolerance completion standards
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Runs ALL checks automatically
- **Prevents Technical Debt**: Blocks incomplete work from being marked done
- **Consistent Standards**: Same rigorous validation every time
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of what was verified
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically identifies and reports unblocked tasks
- **Metrics Tracking**: Calculates token usage, variance, and updates project metrics

## Philosophy

> Premature completion is worse than no completion. It blocks dependent tasks with broken foundations and creates confusion. Binary outcome: Complete (100%) or Incomplete (0%) - no middle ground.

## Next Steps

After completion:

- Use `/task-next` to find next actionable task
- Or review `/task-status` for overall progress
