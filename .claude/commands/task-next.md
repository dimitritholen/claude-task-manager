## MANDATORY AGENT WHITELIST ‚Äî STRICT ENFORCEMENT

**ONLY these agents from this workflow are authorized:**

- ‚úÖ `task-discoverer` - Haiku-optimized fast discovery specialist for manifest-only queries (~150 tokens)
- ‚úÖ `task-manager` - Deep analysis and remediation specialist for planning issues, stalled tasks, and critical path blockages

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ‚ùå ANY agent with same name from global ~/.claude/agents/
- ‚ùå ANY agent from other workflows
- ‚ùå ANY general-purpose agents
- ‚ùå ANY agent not explicitly listed above

**Enforcement:**
This command uses TWO agents depending on system state:
1. **Healthy state** ‚Üí task-discoverer (fast, token-efficient)
2. **Issues detected** ‚Üí task-manager (deep analysis, remediation)

Both agents MUST be from THIS workflow only.

**Why This Matters:**
- task-discoverer: Optimized for 150-token manifest queries, not general searching
- task-manager: Knows this workflow's remediation patterns, atomic updates, and circuit breaker logic
- Global agents do NOT understand this task system's structure or recovery mechanisms

**Configuration:**
Stall thresholds can be customized in manifest.json `config` section:
```json
"config": {
  "stall_threshold_hours": 24,
  "stall_threshold_critical_hours": 72,
  "circuit_breaker_max_retries": 3
}
```
Defaults: 24h warning, 72h critical, 3 retry limit

## Phase 1: Health Check (Manifest-Only Analysis)

**Decision Tree:**
```
‚îå‚îÄ Read manifest.json
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Check for in_progress tasks
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ None found ‚Üí Phase 2 (Discovery)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Found ‚Üí Check timestamps
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ All recent (<24h) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Discovery)
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ Stalled detected ‚Üí Check circuit breaker
‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ Retries < max ‚Üí Escalate to task-manager
‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ Retries ‚â• max ‚Üí Alert user, skip to Phase 2
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Check critical path
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Healthy ‚Üí Continue
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Blocked ‚Üí Escalate if combined with stalls
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Check priority misalignment
   ‚îú‚îÄ Aligned ‚Üí Continue
   ‚îî‚îÄ Misaligned ‚Üí Note for task-manager
```

**FIRST**, check for planning issues before finding next task:

1. **Read `.tasks/manifest.json`** to analyze system health
2. **Detect Anomalies (configurable thresholds):**
   - **Stalled Tasks**: Any `in_progress` tasks with `started_at` > threshold hours?
   - **Critical Path Blockage**: Are tasks on `critical_path` blocked by in_progress tasks?
   - **Priority Misalignment**: Are high-priority (1-2) tasks blocked by stalled work?
   - **Dependency Deadlocks**: Any circular dependencies or impossible conditions?

3. **If Anomalies Detected:**
   - Report the specific issues found
   - Calculate time since stalled tasks started
   - Identify which high-priority tasks are blocked
   - **Check circuit breaker state** in manifest (`config.remediation_attempts` < `config.circuit_breaker_max_retries`)
   - If circuit breaker NOT tripped: **Invoke task-manager agent**
   - If circuit breaker tripped: **Alert user and proceed to discovery** (system needs human intervention)

   **Circuit Breaker Logic:**
   ```
   If manifest.config.remediation_attempts >= manifest.config.circuit_breaker_max_retries:
     1. Report: "Task system remediation has failed 3+ times"
     2. Report: "Manual intervention required - possible systemic issues"
     3. Suggest: Review .tasks/updates/ for remediation history
     4. Proceed to Phase 2 to at least provide next available task
     5. Do NOT invoke task-manager again (prevents infinite loops)
   ```

   **Otherwise, IMMEDIATELY invoke the task-manager agent using the Task tool** with the following prompt:

   ```
   Planning issues detected in task manifest. Perform deep analysis and execute remediation.

   **Detected Issues:**
   [List specific issues you found in step 2 above - be specific with task IDs, timestamps, and impacts]

   **Your Mission:**
   1. Load task files for flagged `in_progress` tasks
   2. Check progress logs and acceptance criteria completion percentages
   3. Analyze `dependency_graph` for critical path blockages
   4. Determine root cause of stalling
   5. **EXECUTE remediation** (not just recommend):
      - Reset stalled tasks to `pending` if abandoned
      - Mark tasks as `blocked` if they have undocumented blockers
      - Update task statuses to reflect reality
      - Adjust priorities if needed
      - Fix dependency violations

   **You MUST:**
   - Use Edit tool to update `.tasks/manifest.json` with corrected task statuses
   - Use Edit tool to update task files in `.tasks/tasks/` if needed
   - Report what actions you took (not what you recommend)
   - At the end, tell user to run `/task-next` again to get correct next task

   **Token Budget:** ~2000-3000 tokens for deep analysis

   Begin analysis and remediation now.
   ```

   Use: `subagent_type: "task-manager"` when invoking the Task tool.

   **STOP after invoking the agent** - let it complete its work.

   **Increment remediation counter:**
   Update manifest.json `config.remediation_attempts` += 1 (reset to 0 on successful completion)

4. **If Healthy:**
   - Reset remediation counter to 0 (if was non-zero)
   - Proceed to Phase 2 (normal task discovery)

5. **If Circuit Breaker Tripped:**
   ```
   üö® Circuit Breaker: Remediation Loop Detected

   The task system has attempted automated remediation 3+ times without success.
   This indicates a systemic issue requiring human intervention.

   Recent Remediation Attempts:
   - <timestamp-1>: <issue-detected>
   - <timestamp-2>: <issue-detected>
   - <timestamp-3>: <issue-detected>

   Recommendations:
   1. Review .tasks/updates/ for remediation history
   2. Check for recurring patterns in task failures
   3. Consider manual manifest correction
   4. Run /task-health for detailed diagnostics
   5. Reset circuit breaker: Edit manifest.json config.remediation_attempts = 0

   Proceeding with next task discovery, but system health is compromised.
   ```

## Phase 2: Task Discovery (If No Anomalies)

**MANDATORY**: Use the `task-discoverer` agent (Haiku-optimized) via the Task tool for fast, token-efficient discovery.

**Invoke the task-discoverer agent with:**

```
Find the next actionable task from the task management system.

**Task:**
1. Read `.tasks/manifest.json` ONLY (do not load task files)
2. Filter tasks by:
   - Status: `pending` (not started)
   - Dependencies: All must be `completed`
   - Blocked: `blocked_by` must be empty
3. Sort by priority (1 = highest)
4. Return the highest priority actionable task

**Token Budget:** ~150 tokens maximum

**Expected Output Format:**
```
üìã Next Task: T00X

Title: <task-title>
Priority: <1-5>
Dependencies: <list or "None">
Estimated Tokens: <number>

Status Summary:
- Total: X tasks
- Pending: X
- In Progress: X
- Blocked: X
- Completed: X

To start this task: /task-start T00X
```

**If No Task Available:**
Report reason:
- "All pending tasks have incomplete dependencies"
- "All tasks are blocked or in progress"
- "No pending tasks found"

Show blocked tasks with their blockers so user can resolve them.

Begin discovery now.
```


**Handling Simultaneous Failures:**

If both health check AND discovery fail:
```
‚ùå Task System Critical Failure

Both health assessment and task discovery have failed.

Health Check Error: <error>
Discovery Error: <error>

This suggests manifest.json corruption or structural issues.

Recovery Steps:
1. Validate manifest: cat .tasks/manifest.json | jq .
2. Check file permissions: ls -la .tasks/
3. Review recent changes: git log .tasks/
4. Restore from backup: .tasks/updates/
5. Last resort: /task-init (WARNING: recreates system)

Cannot proceed without functioning manifest.
```

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Token Efficient**: Healthy state still ~150-300 tokens
- **Self-Correcting**: Automatically detects planning issues
- **Actionable**: User gets clear guidance, not just "next task"
- **Prevents Waste**: Stops working on low-priority tasks while critical path blocked
- **Safe**: Circuit breaker prevents infinite remediation loops
- **Configurable**: Thresholds adapt to project workflow

## Why Use task-discoverer Agent

- **Ultra-fast**: Haiku model optimized for speed
- **Token efficient**: ~150 tokens vs ~1,650 with full context
- **Specialized**: Designed specifically for manifest queries and filtering
- **Reliable**: Consistent output format following discovery patterns

## Why Escalate to task-manager Agent

- **Deep Analysis**: Loads task files to check actual completion state
- **Root Cause**: Determines why tasks are stalled
- **Remediation**: Provides actionable fixes, not just warnings
- **Intelligence**: Understands critical path and priority trade-offs

## Next Steps After Getting Result

- Use `/task-start T00X` to begin work on the identified task
- Use `/task-status` for complete project overview
- Use `/task-health` for standalone health check without finding next task
- Resolve blockers if no tasks are actionable
