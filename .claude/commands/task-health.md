description: Standalone health check for task management system (no task selection)
---

Perform comprehensive health check on the task management system without finding next task.

## Purpose

This command analyzes `.tasks/manifest.json` for planning issues and provides diagnostic report without selecting next task.

Use this when you want to understand system health before making decisions.

For finding next task with health checks, use `/task-next` instead.

Token budget: ~150-300 tokens (manifest analysis only)

## Implementation

**Read `.tasks/manifest.json` and analyze:**

### 1. Stalled Task Detection

- Find all tasks with `status: "in_progress"`
- Calculate time since `started_at` timestamp
- Flag tasks in_progress > 24 hours as "potentially stalled"
- Flag tasks in_progress > 72 hours as "definitely stalled"

### 2. Critical Path Analysis

- Load `critical_path` array from manifest
- Check which critical_path tasks are `completed`, `in_progress`, or `blocked`
- Identify bottlenecks: which in_progress task is blocking most downstream work?
- Calculate critical path completion percentage

### 3. Priority Misalignment Detection

- Find all priority 1 tasks (highest priority)
- Check if any are `pending` but blocked by lower-priority in_progress tasks
- This indicates suboptimal work ordering

### 4. Dependency Health

- Check `dependency_graph` for circular dependencies
- Find tasks with all dependencies completed but still marked `blocked` or `pending`
- Identify orphaned tasks (no blockers, no dependents, not started)

### 5. Task Age Analysis

- Calculate average time tasks spend in each status
- Find outliers (tasks taking much longer than average)
- Check if `estimated_tokens` vs `actual_tokens` variance is high (indicates poor planning)

## Output Format

Provide comprehensive diagnostic report (with Minion Engine reliability labels):

```markdown
# Task Management System Health Report

Generated: <timestamp>
Framework: Minion Engine v3.0 (Evidence-Based Analysis)

## Overall Health: [Healthy | Warning | Critical] 🟢/🟡/🔴 [CONFIDENCE SCORE] [CATEGORY]

## Summary
- Total Tasks: X
- Completed: X (Y%)
- In Progress: X
- Pending: X
- Blocked: X

## Issues Detected

### 🚨 Critical Issues
[Issues that block critical path or prevent progress]

### ⚠️ Warnings
[Issues that should be addressed soon]

### ℹ️  Observations
[Non-urgent observations about task health]

## Detailed Analysis

### Stalled Tasks
| Task ID | Title | Status | Started | Hours Ago | Confidence | Blocks |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|------------|--------|
| T00X | ... | in_progress | 2025-10-12 | 24 | 🟢85 [CONFIRMED] | T00Y, T00Z |

**Evidence:** manifest.json lines X-Y, started_at timestamp verified

### Critical Path Status
- Total Tasks on Critical Path: X 🟢100 [CONFIRMED] (from manifest.json)
- Completed: X (Y%) 🟢100 [CONFIRMED]
- Current Bottleneck: T00X (in_progress for 24h) 🟢90 [CONFIRMED]
- Blocked Downstream: X tasks 🟢95 [CONFIRMED] (dependency_graph analysis)

### Priority Misalignments
[List cases where low-priority work blocks high-priority work]

### Dependency Issues
[List circular dependencies, deadlocks, or inconsistencies]

## Recommendations

1. [Specific action to take]
2. [Specific action to take]
3. [Specific action to take]

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
- [What should be done right now]

**Short Term:**
- [What should be done soon]

**Long Term:**
- [Systemic improvements needed]
```

## Optional: Deep Analysis with task-manager

For complex issues requiring remediation (not just diagnostics), you MAY optionally escalate to `task-manager` agent:

```
Perform comprehensive health analysis of task management system.

**IMPORTANT**: Operate within [Minion Engine v3.0 framework](../core/minion-engine.md).
- Apply Reliability Labeling to ALL diagnoses
- Cite evidence (manifest.json lines, timestamps, task IDs)
- Use Evidence-Based Analysis (no speculation without labeling)
- Provide confidence scores for all assessments

**Your Mission:**
1. Read manifest.json
2. Analyze ALL detected issues in depth
3. Identify root causes
4. Provide detailed diagnostic report (NOT remediation actions)
5. Recommend specific next steps

**Focus Areas:**
- Stalled tasks (>24h in progress)
- Critical path blockages
- Priority misalignments
- Dependency issues
- Token estimate accuracy

**Expected Output:**
Comprehensive health report with specific recommendations (but do NOT execute remediation).

Begin analysis now.
```

Use: `subagent_type: "task-manager"`

**Note:** Only use agent escalation if manifest analysis reveals complex issues requiring deep investigation. For simple diagnostics, direct manifest reading is sufficient.

## DO NOT

- Do NOT select or recommend the next task (that's /task-next's job)
- Do NOT modify manifest.json (report only)
- Do NOT execute remediation (this is diagnostic only)
- Do NOT load individual task files (manifest analysis only for speed)

## Use Case

Run this command when:

- User wants to understand system health before starting work
- Debugging why progress feels slow
- Planning sprint or iteration
- Auditing task management system

Run `/task-next` when actually ready to select and start next task.

## Token Efficiency

- Manifest-only analysis: ~150 tokens
- With agent escalation: ~2,000-3,000 tokens
- Compare to loading all tasks: ~12,000+ tokens

Choose analysis depth based on needs:

- Quick check: Direct manifest analysis
- Deep investigation: Agent escalation
